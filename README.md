So it's been a while since I heard from Bryan Lunduke regarding Linux Tycoon, so here's each e-mail sent to customers. Right until 29th August 2018, at which point I received no more.

Let's start from the top, shall we? So I purchased a copy off the [Linux Tycoon website](http://www.linuxtycoon.com/) for $50. I had missed out on the first game and it wouldn't compile when tried [downloading the code](https://github.com/BryanLunduke/Linux-Tycoon) and putting into Xojo.

Judging by these e-mails the game is perhaps still stuck under legal red tape. Particularly in the realm of free software, it seems companies can be fiercely protective of their trademarks.

## Lunduke-y Goodies!
### 15 Apr 2018
>Thank you for purchasing a copy of Linux Tycoon 2!  The downloadable edition will be sent to you on May 8th.  If you purchased a boxed copy, those will begin shipping out on May 8th as well -- shipping in the order the purchases were made.

>Thank you again for your support.  Now, time for me to get back to duplicating floppies!

## Linux Tycoon 2 Shipping Update!
### 7 May 2018
>Hello all you amazing people that purchased a copy of Linux Tycoon 2!

>I just wanted to give everyone a heads up that the original ship date of 
May 8th has slipped *ever so slightly* to May 11th (3 days).  A 
showstopping bug (that causes saved games to become corrupted beyond 
repair) was discovered yesterday.

>A fix is already in the works and I anticipate this will only take 1 to 
2 days to fix and re-test.  Then another day to re-duplicate the 
floppies and thumb drives.

>I suppose a 3 day slippage isn't so bad.  And I'm very glad this was 
caught before the game was shipped out.  Phew!

>Thanks again and apologies for the delay!  We're almost there!  :)

>Yours in retro-ness,
>-Bryan Lunduke

## Linux Tycoon 2 shipping update #2!
### 10 May 2018

>We've got good news!  The showstopper bug (which turned out to be truly 
gnarly) is fixed!  Phew!

>Early this morning, I sent "Final Candidate" builds of Linux Tycoon 2 
over to a very small number of developers and testers (people I've 
worked with in the past) who have volunteered to do a full test run on 
the game (on all platforms) over the weekend.

>I'm so anxious to get this game shipped and in your hands... I was 
hopeful that the additional 3 days added to the schedule would do it... 
but, deep down, I knew better.  :)

>One of you reminded me of a, most excellent, blog post by Ron Gilbert 
(creator of Monkey Island, Maniac Mansion, and a bunch of other amazing 
games).  He talks about how, at Lucas Arts, if a show-stopper bug is 
found that close to the release date... they bumped the date by a week 
to allow for testing.

>[https://grumpygamer.com/monkey25](https://grumpygamer.com/monkey25)

>Ron Gilbert is smart.  I'm going to listen to Ron Gilbert.  Hence, now 
that the bug is fixed and "in test", I'm moving the release date to 
exactly one week from the original planned launch date.  May 15th 
instead of May 8th.

>Thank you again for all of your support and general awesomeness (and 
patience)!

>-Bryan Lunduke

## Linux Tycoon 2 shipping update #3!
### 14 May 2018

>This will hopefully be the final update to the shipping status of Linux 
Tycoon 2!  ;)

>Short version: The testers over the weekend found that the fix to the 
showstopper bug... was good!  Unfortunately it caused another bug in a 
related bit of code that was also rather gnarly (but, thankfully, 
obvious and easy to fix).  This bug was fixed earlier this morning and 
new builds have been sent out to the "Beta Test Team of Awesome" (that's 
their official code-name).

>To give them time to properly test the build, I am making the executive 
decision to push the release date one additional week (next Monday, May 
21st).  During this time, I am going to assume that no additional 
showstopping issues will be found that will hold up the release... and I 
have begun re-duplicating media in preparation for mailing to all of 
you.

>Thank you to everyone for being patient as we iron this out.  It's 
important to me that it's a fun gaming experience when it arrives in 
your hands.

>-Bryan Lunduke

## Linux Tycoon 2 shipping update #4! (lol!)
### 21 May 2018

>Hello all!

>Short-short version: Binaries on the way!  Read on for details!

>The "Beta Test Team of Awesome" has supplied me with a list of bugs 
that, while not "show-stopper" in severity, they feel should be fixed 
prior to declaring the game "finished".  Things that, while not huge, 
impact the enjoy-ability of the game.

>They're right.  I'm going to listen to them (because they're smart -- 
most are veterans of the game industry).

>It has also been suggested that it would be beneficial to get the game 
into more hands prior to shipping.  Just in case they've missed anything 
critical.

>They're right.  Again.

>So, here's the plan:

>- I'm going fix the handful of "small" issues the Beta Team found.
- Then I'm going to send "Beta Binaries" to all of you.  That'll allow 
you to have fun with the game sooner and give any feedback you'd like.
- After a week of that, I'll begin shipping out the "Gold Master 1.0 
Final Super Awesome" build in boxes on floppies (to those of you that 
ordered the physical version).

>The next email you'll receive from me -- in the coming days -- will 
contain download links for all platforms that Linux Tycoon 2 ships on 
(suitable for playing in emulators, etc.).

>Phew!  Almost there.  So close.  So.  Close.  I can taste it.  Thanks to 
everyone for being patient as we roll towards launch!

>-Bryan Lunduke

## Linux Tycoon 2 shipping update #5! ("This Time It's Personal")
### 29 May 2018

>"Hey everyone, next email you get will have the binaries in it," says an 
over-optimistic Bryan Lunduke.  Let's call those "famous last words."

>The good news: Down to the last 2 known bugs to fix on the "Please Fix 
This So The Game Isn't Annoying" list.  One should be pretty easy.  The 
other, I'm not sure yet.  But close.

>For those who follow me outside of the Linux Tycoon world, you know that 
the last week has been rather crazy.  It slowed  me down.  Plus the 
fixes were more involved than expected.  That's the only excuse I have 
-- just haven't gotten the hands-on coding time I needed to get 
everything fixed.

>Wanted to let all of you know so you're not left wondering.  It's a 
simple, and rather well-worn, tale within software development.  "The 
fix took longer than expected."  :)

>Since the game is technically late to launch -- I want to offer anyone 
who wants it a full refund.  I'm confident we'll see the shipped game 
here in the next few days.  But, I'm a man of my word.  So if anyone 
wants a refund, instead of the game, just let me know.  (Nobody's asked 
for a refund, mind you, but I wanted to offer.  Just so I'm not a total 
jerk-face.)  ;)

>-Bryan

## Linux Tycoon 2 shipping update #6! We're shipping!
### 7 Jun 2018

>Huzzah!  [You can't see me right now, but I'm doing a little happy 
dance.]

>The remaining bugs are *all* fixed -- and the handful of beta testers 
are giving me an enthusiastic thumbs up.

>So... slight change of plans (again).  We're going forward with shipping 
Linux Tycoon 2!

>As a way of saying "thank you" for being so patient through these last 
few weeks of delays, I'm doing a few upgrades!


>== For everyone (Digital download, Box, and Deluxe Box):

>- An OS/2 version of Linux Tycoon 2!  This requires OS/2 Warp 3 or newer 
(including ArcaOS).  This actually was rather easy to accomplish (only 
took about 30 minutes to build and test out) -- this was made possible 
by a bout of insomnia the other night.  :)

>== For those that purchased either Boxed editions (regular and deluxe):

>- I'm adding in a weird little... thing.  I'll let it be a surprise.  ;) 
  (Hint: it's 3D Printed.)

>== For those that purchased the Deluxe Box:

>- The copy of the book "Linux is Badass" in the box is signed.  This 
probably makes it worth like a million dollars.  Give or take.


>I'm going to ship out the digital edition at the same time as the boxes 
(I like the idea of a synchronized launch... just feels good).  This 
afternoon I will begin re-duplicating all the floppies (and thumb 
drives) and getting them into boxes.  This is going to take me a few 
days -- as I only have a one C64 and one Mac I can use to do the 
duplication work.  Once that's done... out they go!

>Thank you again to all of you.  The kind words, the patience, the offers 
of assistance... it all meant a great deal.  I truly hope you get a kick 
out of the game.  It was rather quite a lot of fun (most of the time) to 
build.  :)

>Yours in retro nerdy-ness,

>-Bryan Lunduke

##Linux Tycoon 2 first wave of boxes arriving, other weird news
###2 Jul 2018

>Something rather odd and funky is happening!

>But first the awesome news!  The first round of Linux Tycoon 2 boxes are 
arriving today!

>If you made it into the first set of boxes, you'll have been sent a 
tracking number via email (and it looks like a few of you already have 
received it).  If you didn't receive tracking information, never fear!  
The second batch of boxes (which will contain all of the rest of the 
orders) will be sent out later this week.  Thanks again to everyone for 
your patience as we worked through the final shipping issues -- I think 
it turned out rather fantastically.  :)

>Now, on to the incredibly funky -- and slightly annoying -- thing.

>I have received an email from legal council representing a company (that 
will go unnamed -- for the moment).  They took issue with the fact that, 
in one of the published screenshots for Linux Tycoon 2, a parody name is 
used that is -- admittedly -- clearly based on something owned by their 
company.  They, rather politely, asked that I remove this reference.

>It's sort of a weird thing to ask... what with it being a parody after 
all.  I clearly have the legal right to use the parody name within Linux 
Tycoon.  That said, I also have no desire to get into a (potentially 
expensive) legal battle with a (very) large company.

>On Wednesday I will be meeting with their lawyers to try to resolve 
this.

>Luckily, even if this company demands I remove the parody reference -- 
the only change is in a single plain text file.  The game itself does 
not even need to be re-compiled.  Within Linux Tycoon 2 there is a 
concept of a "Scenario" file that contains all of the Linux Distro & 
Package details (along with a few other fun things).  This is meant to 
be user-editable so that people can create (and distribute) their own 
scenarios for the game.

>What this means:

>If [Company A] decides to demand that I remove the reference, I can do 
so quickly and send out download links for the "new version without the 
offending parody references" (TM).  And the 2nd batch of boxes will 
include this updated version to avoid their wrath.  Which, I suppose, 
means that those of you with the first shipment will have sort of 
collectible (ha!) special edition (as they all contain the "offending" 
words).  :)

>At their request I'm delaying the release of the downloadable edition 
until it's resolved this week.  I think this is silly, but I really 
don't want to risk making them cranky (and I figured all of you would 
understand).

>To answer the questions that I *know* are about to come in:

>Yes.  I'll talk about the details (including what the offending parody 
item was) once this is resolved.  Because it's goofy.  I'm keeping it 
quiet for now so I don't cause any additional difficulty for me (I don't 
want to get yelled at).

>And, no.  It's probably not the one you think it might be.  :)

>-Bryan Lunduke

## Linux Tycoon 2 + Lawyers = Grumpy Lunduke
### 18 Aug 2018

>Hello all you amazingly patient nerds!

>The legal issue with Linux Tycoon 2 it turns out is not yet resolved.  
An issue that I am finding increasingly frustrating by the minute.

>I've asked my attorney to look into what my realistic options are -- 
specifically which options I would be able to afford.  Linux Tycoon 2 
was never a big money-making endeavor (it was, from the start, a labor 
of love because I thought it would be cool to ship a game for older 
platforms in a big box filled with floppies) -- so my legal defense fund 
looks surprisingly similar to my "buy a burger" fund.

>On Tuesday, I'll be meeting with the attorney to go over my options.  As 
I see it there are two possible outcomes:

>1) He shows me a possible way to ship next week or

>2) I provide everyone who hasn't yet received their boxes (which, if 
you're getting this email, includes you) -- or who ordered the download 
version -- a full refund.

>I simply can't ask all of you to wait on this any longer.  You've been 
patient and supportive and awesome, but asking you to wait any longer is 
just something I wouldn't feel cool with.

>So either I'll be emailing you with shipping details on Tuesday... or 
I'll be going down the list hitting the "Refund" button for those of you 
that haven't gotten yours yet.

>Thanks again for all the kind words as I try to make this happen!  All 
of you are truly excellent and deserving of high-fives.

>Now I'm going to go spend the weekend goofing off and trying to forget 
that lawyers exist -- in an effort to keep my blood pressure low.  :)

>-Bryan Lunduke

### 29 Aug 2018

>Well.  After sending this email, literally *every* person except like... 
maybe 2 or 3 of you... replied and told me to forget the refund option 
and get the game to them no mater how long it took.

>You people are crazy.

>Well, that kinda gave me a kick in the pants to figure out a creative 
way to ship the game without running afoul of lawyers and their 
lawyeriness.

>After talking with the attorney about my plan -- and proposing it to the 
company with the complaint -- I got the thumbs up.

>I'll be making a few changes to the game.  Rather tongue-in-cheek 
changes that make me giggle.

>"Bryan Lunduke's Linux Tycoon 2: Extreme Compliance Edition" (yeah, 
that's the full, official name) will ship as soon as I get those in 
place.  I've already begun and think I can finish these up pretty 
quickly.  More to follow shortly, you crazy, crazy dudes & dudettes.

>(And thanks for the amazing support.  Really gave me a boost in making 
this work.  Seriously.  Meant a lot.)

>-Bryan Lunduke
